**Current Source Density Analysis for HD-MEA**  

I contributed as an optimizer and tester to this project, which provides methods for analyzing neuronal activity using data from High-Density Multielectrode Arrays (HD-MEA).  

The pipeline includes:  
- **Data preprocessing**: Converting HDF5 to Juliaâ€™s JLD format for improved data management.  
- **Error detection**: Debugging recording artifacts and discontinuities.  
- **CSD Analysis**: Converting voltage to current flows, identifying sinks/sources, and tracking trajectories.  
- **Active Channel Detection**: Isolating viable tissue signals from noise.  

This software, developed for 3Brain BIOCAM X systems, enables high-resolution insights into neuronal microcircuits and is released under GPL-3.0.

You can find the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/LBitn/Hippocampus-HDMEA-CSDA).
