**OpenGL Dot Matrix Shaders**  

A collection of several OpenGL shaders designed to replicate the dot matrix visual style of Game Boy Color devices, including some artistic interpretations for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. Optimized for modest GPUs present on some Retro-Handheld emulation machines.

Compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 and Desktop OpenGL 130, they are easy to integrate with RetroArch via the online updater or manual installation.

You can find the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/luigira/GBC-dot-matrix-shader).
